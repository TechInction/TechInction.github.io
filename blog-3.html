                        <p>For our standout favorite, the Samsung QN90A Neo QLED is the best TV we've reviewed, delivering superb picture quality with its combination of QLED color and mini-LED backlight (the ingredients that make up Neo QLED).
                            Pair that performance with fantastic sound, rich smart features and a stylish design, and you've got the best TV we've reviewed this year.
                            Just be aware that this premium 4K smart TV doesn't come cheap.
                            We have also just reviewed the LG C1 OLED, which is among the top TVs you can buy. 
                            It's features a gorgeous OLED panel; it's a great 4K smart TV, and it's the best gaming TV we've ever seen.</p>
                        
                        <h1> The best TVs you can buy in 2022 </h1>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">1. Best QLED TV: Samsung QN90A Neo QLED TV</h2>
                        <p>The Samsung QN90A Neo QLED TV combines Samsung's highly refined quantum dot technology with the tight control of mini-LED backlighting, resulting in one of the best TV displays you'll ever see. 
                            Brilliant color and unmatched brightness make for superb performance, and Samsung pairs that with a bounty of smart TV functions and genuinely intelligent features, 
                            like a solar-powered remote control that eliminates the need to swap out batteries-delivering eco-friendly design and unbeaten convenience at the same time.
                            The whole thing is packed into a gorgeous 1-inch-thick design that contains a huge array of smart features, potent Dolby Atmos sound and some of the best performance we've ever seen. 
                            HDMI 2.1 connectivity comes standard, along with gamer-friendly features and impressive 12.6-millisecond lag time for an unparalleled gaming experience.
                            It's the best TV we've seen this year.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">2. Best OLED TV: LG C1 OLED</h2>
                        <p>The LG C1 OLED is a fantastic value among premium TVs, offering an amazing OLED display, a full complement of HDMI 2.1 ports, and the best gaming performance and features you can get. 
                            The display offers rich picture quality with impeccable contrast and sharpness, superb HDR support and gaming performance that beats everything else we've seen. 
                            Combine all of that with a stunning design and better-than-average sound, and you've got one of the best TVs you can buy.
                            LG's webOS faces stiffer competition on app selection and features, but smart options, like your choice of Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice assistants, AI-driven sports alerts, 
                            and gaming features like the game optimizer menu and support for Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Cloud keep it in the mix for the best smart TVs. 
                            Just note that some have complained about a Dolby Atmos audio delay with certain devices, like the Xbox Series X. 
                            All in all, it delivers incredible quality and solid value for the admittedly premium price, making it one of the best TVs we've tested. </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">3. Best TV value: TCL 6-Series Roku TV (R635)</h2>
                        <p>The TCL 6-Series Roku TV (R635) offers enormous value for it's affordable price, offering premium picture quality and a great smart TV experience for much less than the competition.
                            As TCL's best mainstream smart TV the R635 ups the ante with mini-LED backlighting in addition to QLED. 
                            The result is impressive color and brightness, with some of the best HDR performance we've seen on anything this side of an OLED display.
                            But TCL keeps delivering more, like THX Certified Game Mode, which makes the 6-Series one of the best gaming TVs available, even for yet-to-be-released consoles like the PS5 and the Xbox Series X. 
                            From the design's smart touches, like cable management in the stand, to the always-solid Roku TV platform, the TCL 6-Series R635 is the best TV value, and it's not even close.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">4. LG G1 OLED</h2>
                        <p>The LG G1 OLED TV is the updated version of LG's superb Gallery OLED, boasting a premium 20 millimeter-thick design and sleek flush-to-the-wall mounting setup. 
                            It's still the best 4K OLED TV made by LG, but as the first TV with LG's second-gen OLED evo technology, it falls short of some claimed performance improvements we were pretty excited for.
                            That said, the LG G1 OLED is still an impressive OLED set, and LG has even knocked the price down a bit, while updating almost everything else about the set. 
                            The slim OLED features more comfortable remote control, enhanced gaming features, and the latest version of webOS, all while delivering the same excellent picture quality and impeccable sound that we expect from LG's best OLED models. 
                            The LG G1 OLED TV stands as a reminder of just how far modern TV technology has come — we just hope it hasn't plateaued.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">5. TCL 5-Series Google TV (S546)</h2>
                        <p>The TCL 5-Series Google TV (S546) wowed us with its combination of smart TV features, solid performance and great  value for your dollar. Building on the foundation of the already-good 5-Series, 
                            the move to Google TV gives the affordable 4K smart TV a more premium smart TV platform, one that offers personalized and customizable suggestions,
                            a huge assortment of smart features, and deep Google Assistant integration that makes it a viable center for the entire home of connected gadgets.
                            But it also offers a step up in other aspects of the TV. From color quality to lag times, the 5-Series Google TV is a more polished version of the 5-Series TV, delivering an excellent QLED 4K display, 
                            a slick remote control, and a surprisingly wide array of gaming features for a 60Hz TV. 
                            For a smart TV that sells for under Rp14.000.000 for most size options, it's easily one of the best TVs on the market.</p>
